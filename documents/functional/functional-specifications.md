## Overview
Every day, new people try to discover the world of programming, and every day, some of them are confronted with a similar problem. They can learn the basics, but they have trouble learning the algorithms. That's why this project exists. This project is a web application designed to help new developers acquire increased programming skills. With exercises and lessons provided, beginners will be capable of entering the world of algorithms step by step.

### Scope
This project aims to help people progress in algorithmic concepts and acquire new programming skills, but also to help them evaluate their current skills.

### Out of Scope
The project is intended as a learning platform, but it is not intended to replace schools and teachers. It will not deliver any kind of diploma or certification.

## Customers

### Exercises
The app will contain three kinds of exercises:
- **Code correction**: Following the instructions, the user will have to correct a piece of code and execute it to get a password used to validate the exercise.
- **Server code**: Following the instructions, the user will have to write a piece of code and communicate with a server to get a password used to validate the exercise.
- **Code upload**: Following the instructions, the user will have to write a piece of code and upload it. The code will be tested to validate or not the exercise.
