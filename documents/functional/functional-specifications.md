## Overview
Every day, new people try to discover the world of programming, and every day, some of them are confronted with a similar problem. They can learn the basics, but they have trouble learning the algorithms. That's why this project exists. This project is a web application designed to help new developers acquire increased programming skills. With exercises and lessons provided, beginners will be capable of entering the world of algorithms step by step.

### Scope
This project aims to help people progress in algorithmic concepts and acquire new programming skills, but also to help them evaluate their current skills.

### Out of Scope
The project is intended as a learning platform, but it is clearly not intended to replace schools and teachers. It will not deliver any kind of diploma or certification.

## Customers
### For version 1.0

| Stakeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ALGOSUP students | For the first version, the principal customer will be ALGOSUP students, who will exploit the system to improve their skills and gradually learn algorithmic concepts. They can also suggest new exercises on new concepts if they think something is missing. |
| ALGOSUP teachers | Teachers will be able to use the app to target student problems more precisely and focus on them. |
| ALGOSUP Student Council | The student council will be able to use the app to organize events and competitions. |

### For future versions

| Stakeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New developers | The app will be open to everyone, and new developers will be able to use it to acquire new programming skills. |
| Companies | Companies will be able to use the app to evaluate the skills of their future employees. |
