## Project Overview
Every day, new people try to discover the world of programming, and every day, some of them are confronted with a similar problem. They can learn the basics, but they have trouble learning the algorithms. That's why this project exists. This project is a web application designed to help new developers acquire increased programming skills. With exercises and lessons provided, beginners will be capable of entering the world of algorithms step by step.

## Project Goals
To achieve these goals, this project will focus on the following tasks:
- Create a web application containing exercises and documentation.
- Create several exercises with diverse levels of difficulty.
- Create accessible documentation specific to each exercise.
- Make the whole system fun enough to keep users interested.

## Stakeholders
### For version 1.0

| Stakeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ALGOSUP students | For the first version, the principal customer will be ALGOSUP students, who will exploit the system to improve their skills and gradually learn algorithmic concepts. They can also suggest new exercises on new concepts if they think something is missing. |
| ALGOSUP teachers | Teachers will be able to use the app to target student problems more precisely and focus on them. |
| ALGOSUP Student Council | The student council will be able to use the app to organize events and competitions. |

### For future versions

| Stakeholder | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New developers | The app will be open to everyone, and new developers will be able to use it to acquire new programming skills. |
| Companies | Companies will be able to use the app to evaluate the skills of their future employees. |


## Deliverables and Milestones

### Milestones

| Deliverable | Description | Deadline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Functional Specifications | The functional specifications will contain all the information about the app's features and how it will work. | 2024-03-22 |
| Technical Specifications | The technical specifications will contain all the information about the app's architecture and how it will be built. | 2024-04-02 |
| Test Plan | The test plan will contain all the information about how the app will be tested. | 2024-05-01 |

- Functional Specifications
- Technical Specifications
- Test Plan
- First working prototype
- Operator's manual
- First version

## Resources and Constraints

### Resources

For this project, the following resources will be required:
- A server to host the application
- A database to store the exercises and the documentation

### Constraints
The following constraints will be taken into account:
- The application must differentiate ALGOSUP students from other users.
- Exercises must incorporate a gradual level of difficulty.
- The application must be accessible from any web browser.
- The application must be straightforward to maintain and update.
- The application must have a first release date of 2024-09-01.
- The application must respect user privacy.

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| The application is not ready for the first release date | A precise work schedule will be drawn up to meet the deadlines. |
| The application is unaccessible from all web browsers | The application will be tested on all web browsers to ensure its accessibility. |
| The application is uneasy to maintain and update | The application will be built with a modular architecture to facilitate maintenance and updates. |
| The application does not respect user privacy | The application will be tested to ensure it respects user privacy. |

## Overall Plan
To ensure the success of the project, the team will follow the following plan for the development part:
| Priority | Task | Description | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Web application creation | A basic web application will be created. | Prototype |
| 2 | Database creation | A database will be created to store the exercises and documentation. | Prototype |
| 3 | Hosting | A server will be set up to host the application. | Prototype |
| 4 | Correction system | A system will be created to correct the exercises. | Prototype |
| 5 | Exercise creation | Exercises will be created with diverse levels of difficulty. | Prototype |
| 6 | Documentation creation | Documentation will be created for each exercise. | Prototype |
| 7 | User Management | A system will be created to manage users. | Version 1.0 |
| 8 | Statistics | A system will be created to collect statistics on the use of the application. | Version 1.0 |
